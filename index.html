                <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>"Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of s*** and came out clean on the other side."</i>
                    Shawshank Redemption tops the rankings in our hearts as well as the IMDB ones, at an astonishing 9.3/10 topping the charts.

                <h3>Inception</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>“You Mustn't Be Afraid To Dream A Little Bigger, Darling.”</i>
                    Inception is one of those mind bending ones that are a treat to watch and equally difficult if you try to understand. A true masterpiece.

                <h3>Detachment</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>“A child's intelligent heart can fathom the depth of many darkplaces, but can it fathom the delicate moment of its own detachment?”</i>
                    Detachment is one of my personal favourites and also truely underrated. It's more of an art project with a message that should be an artist's must watch.
