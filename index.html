                <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>"Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of s*** and came out clean on the other side."</i>
                    
                    <p>Shawshank Redemption tops the rankings in our hearts as well as the IMDB ones, at an astonishing 9.3/10 topping the charts.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Inception</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>“You Mustn't Be Afraid To Dream A Little Bigger, Darling.”</i>
                    <p>Inception is one of those mind bending ones that are a treat to watch and equally difficult if you try to understand. A true masterpiece.</p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Detachment</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>“A child's intelligent heart can fathom the depth of many darkplaces, but can it fathom the delicate moment of its own detachment?”</i>
                    <p>Detachment is one of my personal favourites and also truely underrated. It's more of an art project with a message that should be an artist's must watch.</p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cash Back</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>“You see, I've always wanted to be a painter, and like many artists before me,
                        the female form has always been a great source of fascination.”</i>
                    <p>This is a risky movie because you either like it with all your heart or you hate it completely. Lucky to be in the former.</p>
